I'm currently studying Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn) at [Southern University of Scicence and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn). I'm more than delighted to share some learning records here.

I'm very grateful for my institution. SUSTech is a representative of innovative new-era's universities in China and I believe it's the best among the best!

Imersed in a vivid environment, I'm committed to learning broadly and making my own contribution to our world.

## Current Learning Interests

## Coming Activities

I'm going to *LMH Summer School Program* (Session 1) held by Lady Margaret Hall of the University of Oxford this summer!

My course will be: *Advanced Artificial Intelligence: Deep Unsupervised Learning*.

I'm also planning to take a one-semester or one-year overseas visiting student program in 2026.
